Define the Access Model (FOUNDATION)

- Goal of Stage 1
    Describe the access system in human terms.
    No logic. No enforcement. Just definitions.

- Objectives
1️⃣ Decide what a Role means in your system

- You must be able to answer:
    Is a role a job? (admin, editor)
    Or a power level? (level_1, level_2)

Objective:
Roles must be stable and long-lived.

2️⃣ Decide what a Permission means

- Permissions must be:
    action-based
    not role-based

- Example thinking (no code):
    “read”
    “create”
    “delete”
    “approve”

- Objective:
    Permissions should describe actions, not users.

3️⃣ Decide the relationship: Role → Permission

Answer this clearly:
    Can a role have many permissions? (yes)
    Can a permission belong to many roles? (yes)

Objective:
    One role = many permissions
    One permission ≠ one role

4️⃣ Define what the system does NOT handle


Decide:
    Does RBAC handle ownership? (usually no)
    Does it handle conditions like time, location? (no, later)

Objective:
Keep RBAC pure and limited.

5️⃣ Decide the single question RBAC must answer

This is the most important sentence:
    “Given a role and an action, should access be allowed?”
    If anything doesn’t help answer this — it doesn’t belong here.
