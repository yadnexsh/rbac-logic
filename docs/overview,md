# Project Overview

This repository contains a lightweight Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) access engine.
The goal is to clearly define access rules and enforce them in a predictable, secure manner.

The project is built in stages:
- System scope definition
- Access policy definition
- Permission check structure
- Python enforcement logic
- Testing and validation

Design decisions are documented before implementation to ensure clarity and correctness.
